TITLE : Calculate Compound Interest.

DESCRIPTION :
	It is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously-accumulated interest.
	The formula for annual compound interest, including principal sum, is:
		A = P (1 + r/n) (nt)
	Where :
		A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
		P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
		r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
		n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
		t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for
