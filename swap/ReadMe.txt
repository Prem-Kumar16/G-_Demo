TITLE : Swapping of two numbers without using "temp" variable

DESCRIPTION : 
	This C++ program swaps two numbers without using temp. A function is also included for swapping. Here is how the swapping process is done

	For example let us take two variable "A" & "B". The value of A is 37 and B is 49.

	-> Step 1 : A = A + B ( so A+B = 86. Therefore value of A becomes 86 )
	-> Step 2 : B = A - B ( so A-B = 86-49 = 37. Therefore B becomes 37 )
	-> Step 3 : A = A - B ( so A-B = 86-37 = 49. Therefore A becomes 49 )
