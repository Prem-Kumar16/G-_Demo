TITLE : Display ASCII Value of a Character.

DESCRIPTION :
	A character variable holds ASCII value (an integer number between 0 and 127) rather than that character itself in C++ programming. That value is known as ASCII value.
	For example, ASCII value of ‘A’ is 65.

	What this means is that, if you assign ‘A’ to a character variable, 65 is stored in that variable rather than ‘A’ itself.
